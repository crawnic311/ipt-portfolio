      I am an experienced instructional designer who specializes in creating
      engaging, learner-centered e-learning experiences and multimedia
      presentations, leveraging innovative strategies to empower individuals and
      drive transformative learning experiences that yield meaningful outcomes.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>I like the outdoors, the indoors, excellent foods, and travelling
      the world as often as I can. I've lived all over the US but the Utah
      mountains have convinced me to stay put for now.
